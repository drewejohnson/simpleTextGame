------------------------------------------------------TEXT BASED PYTHON GAME-----------------------------------------------------

A simple adventure game that is played through the command line. Navigate your adventurer through a dungeoun full of dangerous
enemies and bountiful loot. If you can manage to make your way to the edge of the dungeoun, a terrifying boss awaits you! Defeat the boss
for a glorious prize (bragging rights)

Some things to note about this game:

- Still in development as of 11 July, 2018 as I work on this game in whatever free time I can afford
- The game mechanics are kind of off as I try and dial things like enemy strengths in.
- Combat is *tic-for-tac*, meaning enemies will only attack you if you attack them first. However, you cannot progress forward nor take loot from a
room with enemies.
- The examine command is very powerful. It can be used on enemies, items found in a room or on your person, or the entire room itself. You can also examine yourself by entering `examine self` or `examine name` where name is the name you gave your character

**Installing the Game**

- The game requires the latest Python 3.5.2 or earlier to be installed for some formatting and stuff.
- Download all the .py files in the master branch
- Run "textGame.py" however you usually run python scripts
- You should be off to the races!
